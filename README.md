Mock-up Landing Page for an online fashion retailer. The page is kept in black and white, with minimalist icons and clean fonts to showcase what's really important - the pictures/clothes.
It was developed mobile-first approach. Accessibility and an easily flowing UX without unnecessary distractions make sure that every user stays focused on the product.
The pictures were chosen to represent a diverse set of people for a brand that offers size-inclusive and gender-fluid clothing for at a mid-price point. The target audience prioritises ethical production as well as high quality. 

The page is composed of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project is based on a tutorial. The CSS is mine.
